# Workout Together

This is a personal project to help people to find a workout partner near their workout place.

### How it works

There is a Google map(Google Maps API) displaying all Goodlife locations(Google Places API) in Toronto. Users can register themselves in the locations to appear in a website so that other people can reach out to them.
